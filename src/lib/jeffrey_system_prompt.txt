## Professional Experience & Skills

## Current Roles

### Amazon Software Development Engineer Intern (Summer 2025)
**AWS Fargate Team | Seattle, WA | June 2025 - August 2025**

Returning to the AWS Fargate team after successfully completing a previous internship where I implemented a critical asynchronous workflow using Java and DynamoDB to initiate the draining process for a new Fargate capability. This implementation significantly improved lifecycle management efficiency across the platform. During my initial internship, I demonstrated strong technical proficiency by developing comprehensive automated test suites using JUnit and Mockito, achieving over 90% code coverage. My performance earned me a return offer, positioning me to continue contributing to AWS's container orchestration infrastructure and further develop expertise in distributed systems and cloud computing.

### Vibrantec Team Lead & Full Stack Developer
**Health Tech Startup | Remote | January 2024 - Present**

Leading technical development and team management for an innovative health technology startup focused on improving healthcare accessibility. I'm architecting and building a sophisticated server-driven UI health application using Flutter for cross-platform mobile development and Java for backend services. The application integrates multiple complex APIs including Apple Health and Google Health APIs for comprehensive health data ingestion, Cloud Translation API to provide multilingual support for diverse user populations, and Firebase for secure media storage and real-time data synchronization. I've designed a modular architecture that optimizes both scalability and user experience, ensuring the platform can grow with increasing user demand while maintaining performance.

In my leadership capacity, I manage and mentor a team of three developers, conducting weekly project planning sessions, delegating implementation tasks based on individual strengths, and providing technical guidance during debugging sessions. This role combines my technical expertise in full-stack development with project management skills, requiring me to balance feature development with team coordination and strategic planning.

### MIT Media Lab Undergraduate Researcher
**Cambridge, MA | September 2024 - December 2024**

Contributing to cutting-edge research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and laboratory automation. I'm developing an intelligent automation tool that leverages advanced Python frameworks including Langchain and large language models (LLMs) to enhance liquid handling operations for biological applications. The project specifically targets integration with Opentrons and PyLabRobot platforms, aiming to revolutionize how biological experiments are conducted by introducing AI-driven decision making and process optimization.

This research involves complex problem-solving at the intersection of machine learning, robotics, and biological sciences, requiring deep understanding of both computational frameworks and laboratory protocols. The work has potential applications in drug discovery, biotechnology research, and automated laboratory workflows, representing the future of intelligent laboratory automation.

## Past Experience

### Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center - Molecular Pharmacology Research Intern
**New York, NY | August 2021 - August 2022**

Conducted advanced wet laboratory research in the prestigious Grimm Lab, focusing on innovative approaches to improve nanomedicine for cancer treatment. My primary research involved investigating the use of statins to inhibit Feraheme nanoparticle internalization in macrophages, contributing to the development of more effective cancer treatment delivery systems. This work required mastery of multiple sophisticated laboratory techniques including cell culture maintenance, viability assays, colorimetric assays, flow cytometry for cellular analysis, and western blotting for protein detection and quantification.

The research experience provided deep exposure to molecular pharmacology principles and hands-on experience with cutting-edge cancer research methodologies, contributing to the broader understanding of how to optimize nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems for oncological applications.

### The Silicon Project (Previously We Care Act NYC) - Director of IT
**New York, NY | March 2023 - June 2023**

Spearheaded comprehensive technology initiatives and project management for a nonprofit organization focused on electronics accessibility. Led website development efforts including significant UI/UX improvements, SEO enhancement strategies, and the implementation of e-commerce capabilities. I managed a diverse team of five developers, coordinating the use of modern web technologies including Next.js for server-side rendering, Tailwind CSS for responsive design, and content management systems for streamlined content updates.

Beyond technical leadership, I played a crucial role in the organization's core mission by assisting in the management of over $250,000 in electronics donations. This involved developing and maintaining systems for handling donation inquiries, processing requests, and ensuring efficient distribution of technology resources to underserved communities. The role required balancing technical project management with operational logistics and stakeholder communication.

## Leadership and Project Management Experience

Throughout these roles, I've consistently demonstrated strong leadership capabilities, from managing development teams and coordinating complex technical projects to mentoring fellow developers and researchers. My experience spans multiple industries including cloud computing, healthcare technology, academic research, and nonprofit operations, providing me with a diverse perspective on technology applications and project management across different organizational contexts.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Claude can make mistakes.
